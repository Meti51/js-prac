        <p>The modern English word school derives from an old
          English word, scol, that derives from Latin, schola,
          meaning “a break from work,” “leisure dedicated to
          learning,” “a place for intellectuals to gather to
          discuss issues,” and other similar concepts. The Latin word,
          in turn, derived from the Greek word, skhole, with identical
           meanings. Despite its vague meaning originally, the word was
           incorporated into most Western languages: French (école),
           Spanish (escuela), Italian (scuola), German (Schule), Swedish
           (skola), Gaelic (sgiol), Welsh (ysgol), and Russian (shkola)</p>
